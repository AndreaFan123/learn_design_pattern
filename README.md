### Singleton

#### Why Singleton?

Singleton ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when you need to :

- Control the number of instances that can be created.
- Create a single point of access to a particular object.

It's like having only one control panel through which you manage all the operations of a system.
